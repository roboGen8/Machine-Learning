I used Weka and scikit-learn just for Neural Networks

Download:

Weka:
Go to Preprocess tab
Open file...
Go to Cluster tab
Choose k-means or EM
set varying number of clusters
make sure otherconfiguration is what you want
press start
Take not of data in EXCEL

For PCA:
Go to Preprocess tab
Choose Filter -> PrincipalComponents

Scikit-learn NN:
python neuralNet_mushrooms
python neuralNet_pulsar

make sure to change to correct file in script
